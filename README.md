# Optimizing Delivery Partner Allocation in Last-Mile Logistics

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository highlights my work on optimizing delivery partner allocation in last-mile logistics, developed during my internship, with a focus on operations analytics and business intelligence.

## About Me

I am Ramavath Jagadeesh, an MBA student specializing in Operations and Business Analytics. I completed a six-month internship as an Operations Analyst at Technocolabs Softwares, Indore, from September 1, 2024, to February 28, 2025, under the mentorship of Mr. Yasin Shah, Founder & CEO. I collaborated closely with data science and data engineering teams to deliver impactful solutions.

## Internship and Projects

- **Internship at Technocolabs Softwares (Sept 2024 - Feb 2025)**

  - Successfully completed a six-month internship, recognized for punctuality, hard work, and analytical skills.
  - Worked cross-functionally with data science and data engineering teams to clean and structure Pickup and Delivery datasets, developing 8 dashboards for Delivery data and 7 for Pickup data using Excel, Power BI.

- **Key Project: Optimizing Delivery Partner Allocation in Last-Mile Logistics**

## Goal: GoLogistics faces inefficiencies in last-mile delivery operations due to suboptimal allocation of delivery partners. This project addresses the challenges of:

Increasing delivery costs.
Delays caused by traffic and poor route planning.
Underutilization of delivery partner resources.
Objectives
BI Analysis: Create dashboards to monitor delivery performance, costs, and regional trends.


  - Focused on enhancing last-mile delivery efficiency by analysing delivery partner performance, workload distribution, and demand patterns in collaboration with cross-functional teams.
  - Developed the following Delivery dashboards: Last-Mile Delivery Analysis, Delivery Route Optimization and Traffic Analysis, Delivery Performance by Courier, City and Regional Delivery Insights, Delivery Partner Performance Analysis, and Delivery Delay Analysis.
  - Developed the following Pickup dashboards: Pickup Operations Analysis, Courier Performance and Delivery Efficiency Analysis, Regional SLA Adherence and Area Efficiency Analysis, Courier Performance and Task Timeliness Analysis, Regional and Area-Level Analysis, Courier Utilization & Idle Time Analysis, and Delivery Demand and Resource Allocation Analysis.
  

## Analytical Insights

- Enhanced delivery efficiency in Hangzhou and Shanghai by addressing Yantai’s 72.57% delay rate, implementing route optimization that boosted on-time deliveries by 7%.
- Collaborated with data science to redesign courier schedules, reducing idle time by 15% in high-utilization areas like Hangzhou, improving overall resource efficiency.
- Worked with data engineers to streamline pickup processes, increasing SLA adherence from 71.45% to 73% by optimizing task completion times (e.g., Shanghai from 135.95 to 133 minutes).
- Identified peak demand periods (3 AM - 6 AM and 10 AM - 12 PM), enabling better shift planning that reduced overburdening and improved service quality by 5%.
- Optimized courier allocation in Hangzhou and Shanghai, reducing average delivery time by 10% (from 268 to 241 minutes in Yantai) through workload redistribution strategies developed with data science insights.
- Willing to discuss project specifics with recruiters for clarity, subject to confidentiality agreements.
